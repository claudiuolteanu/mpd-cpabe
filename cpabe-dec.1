[\fIOPTION \fR...] \fIPUB_KEY PRIV_KEY FILE\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Decrypt FILE using private key PRIV_KEY and assuming public key
PUB_KEY. If the name of FILE is X.cpabe, the decrypted file will
be written as X and FILE will be removed. Otherwise the file will be
decrypted in place. Use of the \fB\-o\fR option overrides this
behavior.
